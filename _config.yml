title: Bridging the Gap: Digital Twin Integration and Evaluation in Robotic Multi-Axis Additive Manufacturing
description: This study explores integrating digital twin technology with robotic multi-axis additive manufacturing to improve manufacturing precision and efficiency. A laser tracker calibrates the machine workspace and tools, incorporating an industrial robot with a filament extruder head and a rotary-tilt positioner. The digital twin captures the details of the manufacturing process and automates code generation for robotic operations. The method’s effectiveness is shown through the production of two complex parts, assessing their dimensional accuracy to evaluate the technology’s limits and potential. The results show substantial improvements in aligning virtual models with physical objects, demonstrating the digital twin’s ability to reduce common deviations in traditional manufacturing.
